At the top of every RMarkdown file, you'll see a `YAML` metadata header section enclosed by `---`. By default, it will populate the file **title**, **author**, **creation date**, and **output file type**, but there are *tons* of ways to customize it to apply functions and formatting across your entire document. These options can vary by output file type. For `.html` files, see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) and for `.pdf` files, see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html).

For our **A *very* important report on global UFO sightings and abductions** `.html` document, we used the following yaml specifications:

```

title: "A *very* important report on global UFO sightings and abductions"
author: "Sam Csik & Juliette Verstaen"
date: "March 2021"
output:
  html_document:
    code_folding: hide
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    theme: spacelab
editor_options: 
  chunk_output_type: console
---
```

Notice that we can specify both `output` and `editor_options`. Anything that we specify under `output:` applies to our knitted/rendered `.html` document, whereas specifying `editor_options:` alters RStudio's default behaviors. For example, I prefer to see outputs rendered in the console when testing (rather than the default in-line renderings).

Other additions we've made are: 

* **`code_folding:`** hide/show; if hide, defaults to collapsed code chunks with the ability to expand/show them individually
* **`toc:`** true/false; if true, include a Table of Contents based on any specified headers
* **`toc_float:`** true/false: if true, Table of Contents floats so that it is always visible, even when the document is scrolled
* **`theme:`** set the Bootstrap theme to use across your document; valid themes include default, cerulean, journal, flatly, darkly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti
