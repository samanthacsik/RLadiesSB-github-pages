You are able to format text in `.Rmd` files using [Pandoc's Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_pandoc_markdown.html), a set of markdown annotations for plain text files. When you render (i.e. 'knit') your file, Pandoc transforms your marked up text into beautiful, report-worthy formatted text.

There are so many great online resources for learning the markdown syntax used throughout this tutorial, so rather than copying content, we'll link a few here:
