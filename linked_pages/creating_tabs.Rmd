You'll notice that we've organized some of our content using tabs. This is done by applying the `{.tabset}` class attribute to headers (denoted here by `##`) within your document, making any sub-headers (denoted here by `###`) appear in tabs.

```markdown
## Alien Abductions {.tabset}

### All accounts of abductions

(insert code chunk/content here; you'll find our DT table code here)

### Map of alien abductions

(insert code chunk/content here; you'll find our leaflet code here)
