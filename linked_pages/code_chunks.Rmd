```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Code chunks allow you execute code and embed the results within your R Markdown document. A code chunk is created by typing the delimeters ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` ` and sandwiching your code in between. When specifying code chunk options, you can either:

* set options for individual chunks by listing them within the braces and after the `r` (e.g. ` ```{r, warning = FALSE} `), or 
* set global chunk options that apply across your entire document by calling `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`, typically in the first, auto-generated chunk in your R Markdown file (e.g. `knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)`)

While there are over *50* chunk options to help you customize the behavior of knitr when processing code chunks, we most commonly use the following options:

<br>

* `message = FALSE` : prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the knitted document
* `warning = FALSE` : prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the knitted document
* `echo = FALSE` : prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the knitted document; this is how we are able to load packages, but not have `library(...)` from printing in our knitted file; you can also use this to embed figures, but not their code in your documents
