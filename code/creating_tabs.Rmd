```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You'll notice that we've organized some of our content using tabs. This is done by applying the `{.tabset}` class attribute to headers (denoted here by `##`) within your document, making any sub-headers (denoted here by `###`) appear in tabs.

```markdown
## Alien Abductions {.tabset}

### All accounts of abductions

(insert DT table code chunk here)

### Map of alien abductions

(insert leaflet code chunk here)
